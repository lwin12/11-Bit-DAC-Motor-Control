# 11-Bit-DAC-Motor-Control
This project demonstrates how we can control a higher voltage source using a microcontroller unit. 
In this project, i was tasked to control the higher voltage source by using a STM32 Black Pill, i used an optocoupler to seperate the higher voltage from the BlackPill.

This project was done back in 2022, after I graduated from Ngee Ann Polytechnic.

Components used:
- x1 STM32F11CEU6
- x1 2.42inch OLED Screen
- x9 Non latching buttons
- x11 Optocoupler 

PS: See the file "11 Bit DAC_MOS Inverter_Optocoupler.pdf" for the connections & "PIN MAPPING.text" for software pins.
