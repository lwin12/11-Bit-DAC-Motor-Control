# 11-Bit-DAC-Motor-Control
This project demonstrates how we can control a higher voltage source using a microcontroller unit. 
In this project, i was tasked to control the higher voltage source by using a STM32 Black Pill, i used an optocoupler to seperate the higher voltage from the BlackPill.

This project was done back in 2022, after I graduated from Ngee Ann Polytechnic.
